# Re-POIROT

Threat hunting involves identifying the presence of APT vectors in an enterprise organization. Given IOCs in the form of a query graph and a provenance graph, POIROT intends to perform efficient graph matching to identify APTs. This repository contains an implementation of [POIROT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3319535.3363217).  

The source code of POIROT and instructions to run it can be obtained by navigating to the `poirot/` directory.

The datasets (provenance and query graph files) used for performing experiments in the final project report can be obtained by navigating to the `datasets/` directory.
